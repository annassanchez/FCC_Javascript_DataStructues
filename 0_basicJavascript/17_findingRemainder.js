//the remainder operator is %
//example:
/*5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)*/
//usage: check if a number is odd or even
/*17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)*/
//exercise: set remainder to 11 divided by 3
var remainder = 11 % 3;
var remainder;
