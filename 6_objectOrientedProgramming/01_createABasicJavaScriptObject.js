//think about things people see every day, ike cars, shops and birds. these are all objects: tangible things that you observe and interact with
//some qualites of objects can be wheels, items to be sold, wings for birds
//these are qualities (properties), define what makes up an object
//similar objects can share similar properties, but may differ on the values of those properties
//for example: a car has for wheels but not all cars have the same number of wheels
//objects in JS are used to model real-world objects, giving them properties and behaviour
//here's an example with a duck object
let duck = {
	name: "Aflac",
	numLegs: 2
};
//this object has two property/value pairs
//example: create a dog object with name and numLegs properties, and set them respectively to a str and a num
let dog = {
    name: "Pepe",
    numLegs: 4
  };
